## Inspiration

Note-taking in work meetings is often dismissed. Taking notes during seminars or lectures can be frustrating, as you are supposed to also pay attention to the lecturer. We wanted to automate the note taking intelligently, as the latest technologies enable great quality.

## What it does

It's a central platform where audio files can be sent, and where they can be processed. It summarizes the audio file as bullet points, and enables topic search from the original transcription.

## How we built it

We built it with Python, using AssemblyAI, GPT3 and Gradio.

## Challenges we ran into

There were challenges such as getting the output sound from the audio card of the PC to enable cross-platform recording from any meeting (Google Meets, Teams), but we managed to get a solution to be started.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of the quality of the summarization and the topic retrieval from the transcription. We also brainstormed and built the idea during the hackathon, not before the hackathon (as in hackathon spirit).

## What we learned

We learned important lessons from integrating external APIs and storing cross-session information. 

## What's next for NotePal

NotePal has the possibility to be The central platform, where any device can be integrated to. We have phone application, desktop application, and web application that are coming up.
